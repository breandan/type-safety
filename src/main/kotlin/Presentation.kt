    " There is a race between the increasing
      complexity of the systems we build and our
      ability to develop intellectual tools for
      understanding their complexity.

      If the race is won by our tools, then
      systems will eventually become easier to
      use and more reliable. If not, they will
      continue to become harder to use and less
      reliable for all but a relatively small
      set of common tasks.

      Given how hard thinking is, if those
      intellectual tools are to succeed,
      they will have to substitute calculation
      for thought. " --Leslie Lamport

Although mathematical notation undoubtedly possesses
parsing rules, they are rather loose, sometimes
contradictory, and seldom clearly stated...

The proliferation of programming languages shows no more
uniformity than mathematics. Nevertheless, programming
languages do bring a different perspective...

Because of their application to a broad range of topics,
their strict grammar, and their strict interpretation,
programming languages can provide new insights into
mathematical notation. --Kenneth Iverson
